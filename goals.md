## Goals
This project connects my interest in machine learning to quantum concepts. After this, I'm looking forward to explore potential quantum algorithms for machine learning in finance too. I hope to pursue a career somewhere at the intersection of AI and Finance, and the idea of Quantum computers emerging as a new technology makes this intersection even more exciting. Maybe there could be some revolutionary advancement in QML and I could find a great niche in that. All in all, MathQuantum was an amazing program. It made me realize how much I DON'T know about the capabilities of modern technologies. I hope in the future, if I work with AI models, quantum computing will be a more commercial technology that I can be able to use as well.
