# Tools & Techniques

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) combines quantum mechanics with classical machine learning principles. It uses quantum circuits as models for encoding data, finding patterns, and performing optimizations.

## **Mathematical Foundations**

- **Qubits and Superposition:**  
  $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle,\ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.$$

- **Quantum Gates:** Quantum gates, such as the **Hadamard** or **Pauli-X**, are unitary matrices that transform quantum states:  
  $$
  H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}.
  $$

- **Measurement:**  
  $$P(0) = |\alpha|^2,\ P(1) = |\beta|^2.$$

- **Variational Circuits:** Parameterized quantum circuits \( U(\theta) \) act like trainable layers in neural networks, optimized with classical gradient-based algorithms to minimize a cost function.

## **Quantum Machine Learning Techniques**

### **1. Quantum Feature Maps**
Classical data \( x \) can be embedded into a quantum state \( |\phi(x)\rangle \) using a unitary transformation \( U(x) \).  
These embeddings allow quantum computers to calculate inner products (kernels) faster, useful for **classification problems** like those solved by classical SVMs.

### **2. Quantum Kernels**
A quantum kernel computes  
$$
K(x, y) = |\langle \phi(x) | \phi(y) \rangle|^2,
$$  
which measures similarity between data points in a **high-dimensional Hilbert space**—a concept similar to kernel methods in classical machine learning.

### **3. Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs)**
Variational circuits \( U(\theta) \) act as quantum analogs to neural networks.  
The parameters \( \theta \) are optimized using hybrid quantum-classical loops:
1. Encode data into qubits.
2. Apply parameterized gates.
3. Measure output probabilities.
4. Use a classical optimizer to update \( \theta \).

### **4. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**
QAOA can be adapted for **combinatorial optimization** tasks that appear in machine learning (like feature selection or clustering).
