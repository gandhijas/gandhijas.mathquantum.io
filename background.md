## Context
Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in how information is processed, moving beyond classical bits to quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in superpositions of states. This fundamental property allows quantum algorithms to explore multiple possibilities simultaneously, potentially offering exponential speedups for certain tasks.
Machine learning, on the other hand, has become the backbone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and financial forecasting. However, classical machine learning algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional datasets, optimization challenges, and computational bottlenecks.

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is the fusion of these two powerful fields. By leveraging quantum principles such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, QML algorithms aim to process data more efficiently, find patterns faster, and even solve problems that are computationally infeasible for classical computers.

## Motivation
The motivation for exploring QML lies in its transformative potential. Imagine being able to train machine learning models in seconds rather than days, or uncover complex correlations in massive datasets that classical computers cannot analyze efficiently.
For industries like finance, drug discovery, and cybersecurity, QML could lead to breakthroughs in portfolio optimization, molecular simulations, and encryption systems. Personally, I’m motivated by the idea of combining my interests in AI and mathematics with cutting-edge quantum computing techniques to prepare for the next generation of technology.
