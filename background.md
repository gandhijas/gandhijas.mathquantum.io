## Context
Classical machine learning relies on linear algebra and optimization but struggles with massive datasets. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) uses qubits and quantum gates to process information in parallel, offering potential speedups.

## Motivation
AI is growing exponentially, but classical hardware is hitting limits. QML could be the future of AI.
