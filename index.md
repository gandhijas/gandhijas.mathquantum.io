# **Project Idea**
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) combines quantum mechanics and machine learning to create algorithms that could outperform classical AI models. This project will explore how quantum circuits and qubit-based approaches can enhance learning, classification, and prediction.

{: .notice--info}
**Fun Fact:** A single qubit can represent a superposition of 0 and 1, meaning a quantum model can explore multiple states simultaneously.
